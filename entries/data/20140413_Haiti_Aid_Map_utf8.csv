During the first year of implementation, LAMIKA focused on conducting participatory assessment and design activities in the target area of Campeche, a neighborhood in Carrefour-Feuilles near Port au Prince. Over the next three years, the American Red Cross will implement LAMIKA with the goal of enhancing community and household resiliency while providing safer, healthier and more secure living conditions.  LAMIKA will contribute to a more hazard resistant Port au Prince and a better future for Haiti. LAMIKA will conduct activities in social empowerment, economic strengthening and physical renewal to address needs across sectors.  Likewise, activities will be designed to respond to needs at various scales, from the individual household to the municipal and national level.  The overall implementation strategy will be driven by a community-based, participatory approach. This project expects to reach an estimated 45,000 people with a range of services.

Clubs provide safe spaces for girls to meet with their peers and receive life skills training on topics including leadership, health, and reproductive rights.  It aims to establish more 3 youth clubs.  BRAC will directly support the clubs for approximately two years with the ambition that the adolescent girls and young women will use their new skills and confidence to continue to support each other for the rest of the project duration and even beyond, and maintain a network long into the future. For at least the first two years after the project, BRAC will keep in contact with the girls and young women to monitor their progress and provide support.

As a result, most graduates of secondary school are ill-prepared and presented with few opportunities to compete in a modern global economy that stresses information literacy, independent problem solving, and collaborative decision making.  The Bishop Tharp Business and Technology Institute (BTI) is an Episcopal community college located in the southwestern city of Les Cayes.  BTI addresses youth’s education needs by training young people in key business management skills through a two-year curriculum offering two Associate degrees: an Associate of Applied Science in Business Management and an Associate of Applied Science in Computer Support Technology.  In response to the evolving Haitian job market (post-2010 earthquake) BTI has introduced two new courses focusing on NGO management and construction management.","For the 2013-2014 school year, BTI has the following key objectives: 1) RETENTION FOR GRADUATION:  To improve access and educational opportunities to at least 450 students (of which an estimated 70% will be women) through an anticipated offering of 60 courses in a learning environment within (or near) their home communities; 2) QUALITY EDUCATION FOR JOB PLACEMENT: To provide a high quality education that will ensure the employment of at least 50% of graduating students (est. 105) and thus address the various and evolving needs of the Haitian business community in les Cayes; and3) INSTITUTIONAL SUSTAINABILITY: To strengthen institutional sustainability through increases in self-generating income and improvements in administrative efficiencies.","BTI is modeled after community colleges in the United States. The institute operates under the auspices of the Episcopal Diocese of Haiti, with support from Episcopal Relief and Development and parishes and individuals throughout the United States. Since its inception in 2007, BTI has produced 653 skilled graduates, of which reports show that over 60% were employed in fields such as banking, government administration and NGO services within the first year following graduation.

In 2014, the microcredit program intends to provide loans to up to 60 clients in the communities of Lascahobas, Mirebalais and Carrefour.  Previously in 2011, the microcredit program provided 92 entrepreneurs (including 60 women) loans ranging from 5,000 to 25,000 gourdes (US$120 to $625). Loans are only accessible for the creation, recovery or expansion of businesses and cannot be used for consumption purposes (e.g., household purchases, school fees, construction, etc.). All loan repayments, regardless of the amount, are due monthly, with the full loan amount being repaid within 6 months.  ","In 2014, the expanded services and objectives of the livelihood recovery program will include:  1) Microcredit Service: To facilitate 60 entrepreneurs decapitalized by the 2010 earthquake to have access to credit at a preferred interest rate of 2.5% with the intent to contribute to the restarting or growth of their economic activities by at least 35% within a period of 6 months;  2) Service Expansion: To enrich existing credit services with the integration of life skills, health and business management curriculums, and to promote a culture of savings.","For additional information see Episcopal Relief & Development's webpage at: http://www.episcopalrelief.org/where-we-work/country/haitiJanuary 2014 story at: http://blog.episcopalrelief.org/blog/relief-and-development-reflections/four-years-later-long-term-recovery-continues-in-haiti",06/01/2011,12/31/2014,,|Economic Recovery and Development|,,,Castle Rock Foundation,"Parish of Ascension of Thor in Carrefour, Parish of St Pierre in Mirebalais, Parish of Saint Esprit in Lascahobas",,152,"Internally displaced persons (IDPs), Vulnerable people/populations, Women, Youth ",|Haiti>Centre>Lascahobas>Lascahobas|Haiti>Centre>Mirebalais>Mirebalais|Haiti>Ouest>Croix-des-Bouquets>Croix-Des-Bouquets|Haiti>Ouest>Léogâne>Leogane|Haiti>Ouest>Port-au-Prince>Carrefour|Haiti>Ouest>Port-au-Prince>Port-au-Prince|,Tammi Mott,International Program Officer,tmott@episcopalrelief.org,,,09/15/2011,01/10/2014,active,|Private donations|

These conditions have prevailed throughout Haiti’s history and have condemned a majority of its population to abject poverty. On top of this chronic food insecurity, the recent earthquake and hurricanes erased any shreds of resiliency from the already weakened and anemic rural communities. Homes, schools, churches, and stores toppled; crops were wiped out; and roads and bridges were washed away. Critically, livestock were destroyed, leaving rural households without the means to finance their own recovery. In effect, their savings accounts were depleted.  Restoring these savings through the sustainable replenishment and production of crops and livestock herds must be a priority in the economic recovery and rebuilding of rural livelihoods in Haiti. Toward that end, Heifer International has designed and seeks to implement a 5-year project that will target 20,250 vulnerable households in strategic communities in Haiti. This project will “foster a diversified and competitive Haitian economy, leveraging the nation’s entrepreneurial spirit in inclusive and environmentally conscious ways, enabling people, communities and businesses to thrive and prosper.” ","Restocking animals, training farmers in their care and fostering integrated farming by combining livestock with the agroecological production of food crops and animal feed.establish 150 breeding and multiplication centers as rural enterprises to supply quality animals to the target population and foster rural employment.

Desarmes is located in the fertile Artibonite River and the area targeted in this project is split between two municipal boundaries, the 3rd and 4th sections of the Verrettes Commune. In comparison with other areas in Haiti, the 4th section of the Verrettes commune has a large number of springs. However, lack of investment and improper management has under-utilized the potential for these springs. Available water is disproportionately diverted to those who have greater economic means and who are closest to the springs themselves. Other residents in the area must get their drinking water from a private water business (5 gourdes/gallon); the house of a neighbor who has a private water line; from the nearest reservoir; a public fountain; or the primary irrigation canal. Since the cholera outbreak in October 2010, the urgent need for potable water has intensified as nearly 600,000 Haitians became sick and over 7,450 Haitians died from the disease. Three currently existing water systems are being completely renovated, rehabilitated and their services re-organized to provide water in the community in a more efficient and equal manner.

In addition, the peasants’ limited knowledge in group organization, business management and appropriate technical practices constitutes another major obstacle.In response to that situation, World Concern Haiti / ACLAM have started in September 1989 credit activities in North West, then South, Central Plateau and West with technical and financial assistance of World Concern Seattle, PRET/DAI Global Hope Funds etc. And by the end of 2008 we began some negotiations with World Relief staff due to the crisis that affected their credit system and by the end of 2009 we finally merged world Concern and World Relief credit program.
