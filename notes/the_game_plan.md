GamePlan
===========

current Goal: De-Duplication

In order to identify duplicates from the combined dataset.

Step 1:

- Thread 1: Finish tying each dataset to a location. For the datasets that don't have lat-lon, match them to the appropriate admin zone
	-completed on 8 June by Tom

- Thread 2: Research the best way to find compare and find similar strings. We want something more advanced than a 'like' function
is there something like a python library that does this? nltk (natural language toolkit)

Step 2:

- Thread 1: create a psuedo-code version of the de-duplicator. It should look similarities from organization names as well as locations,
maybe times as well?


Other, to-do list:

-finish writing temporary table to display most important information in QGIS

-start looking into WebGIS

-Think about adding description to effort instances table

-Start thinking about moving to a different branching Git model(dev and production versions)
