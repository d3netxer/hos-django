current Goal: De-Duplication

In order to identify duplicates from the combined dataset.

Step 1:

- Thread 1: Finish tying each dataset to a location. For the datasets that don't have lat-lon, match them to the appropriate admin zone

- Thread 2: Research the best way to find compare and find similar strings. We want something more advanced than a 'like' function
is there something like a python library that does this?

Step 2:

- Thread 1: create a psuedo-code version of the de-duplicator. It should look similarities from organization names as well as locations,
maybe times as well?
