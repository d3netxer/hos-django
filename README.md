HopeOneSource Geospatial Database

This project consists of a GeoDjango implementation of a PostGIS database. The HOS database
models health facilities in Haiti including their locations and the services they provide.

The file structure shown follows the typical Django file structure. 

The haiti_geospatial_data folder consists of shapefiles used for a web map.

The notes folder contains relevant notes, but nothing the code is dependent on.
